# Fabric Sync
This folder is shared with the world, so let's make sure to help keep it tidy.

## Before Continuing
Go ahead and create a new folder in `homes`, matching your username.  This is
important, as it will reserve your name in the upcoming FabricOS default filesystem.

For example, I created `homes/martindale` as it matches my public handle.

## Confidential Information
Anything contained within this directory should be considered confidential, and
should not be shared outside of the team unless authorized to do so.

## Naming Conventions
As best we can, let's name everything in `lowercase` and use `-` to separate
words and ideas in the filenames.  This will make our lives much easier in the
near future, as we migrate to tag-based filesystems in as automated a fashion as
possible.

## Git Repository
Stored within this directory is a `.git` subdirectory, which houses the database
for the Git Version Control System.  You can freely use `git` locally to manage
document snapshots.

For an introduction to Git, read [the Maki Developer Guide][getting-started].

## Ask For Help
If you need anything, or even have questions, don't hesitate to speak up.  You
might help document something for others!

Code on,
